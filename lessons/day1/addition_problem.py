# Write a program that takes in two number inputs, one after each other
# and then prints the value of them added together

# FIRST: Write step by step instructions of what you need to do

#Step 1: Create 2 different number variables
number1 = input()
number2 = input()


#Step 2: Add the two number variables together 
#A - Set both variables above to integers so that they can be added
number1 = int(number1)
number2 = int(number2)
print (number1 + number2)

# another way to do the same
print(int(number1) + int(number2))
